Given 𝑛 pairs of parentheses and 𝑚 pairs of square brackets, write a function to count all combinations of well-formed sequences.
In the well-formed sequence, each square brackets pair cannot be enclosed within parenthesis pair.
Also, both two sides of a parentheses pair should be simultaneously enclosed or not enclosed in a square bracket pair.
For example, "[()]" and "()[]" are well-formed sequences, while "([])" and "[(])" are not well-formed sequences.
